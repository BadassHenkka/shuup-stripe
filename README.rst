Running tests
-------------

Tests are run with `py.test <http://pytest.org/>`__.  If you already have
a virtualenv where you are able to run Shuup's tests, you should be able
to run these in the same virtualenv.  A stub `package.json` exists with
a properly configured `test` script, so all you need to do is::

    npm test
